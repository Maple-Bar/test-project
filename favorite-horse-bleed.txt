The horse is one of the most beautiful and complex animals, and has fascinated mankind for many thousand years. 
There are more than 150 different breeds and types of horses in the world. The development of each of them has been influenced by man. Domestication resulted in selective breeding, and many instances, more nutritious feeding, both of which led to an increase in size or quality (or both) of the horse. Here are some examples of breeds that are commonly known by people. 

If you are a begiener or advanced rider, the following horse breed might suit you. These are my favorites:
