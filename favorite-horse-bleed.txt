The horse is one of the most beautiful and complex animals, and has fascinated mankind for many thousand years. 
There are more than 150 different breeds and types of horses in the world. The development of each of them has been influenced by man. Domestication resulted in selective breeding, and many instances, more nutritious feeding, both of which led to an increase in size or quality (or both) of the horse. Here are some examples of breeds that are commonly known by people. 

If you are a begiener or advanced rider, the following horse breed might suit you. These are my favorites:

Thoroughbred - OTTH could be trained to be an excellent show jumper and dressage horse.
Hanoverian - Warm blood. Excellent jumber, and has very calm disposition.
Dutch Warmblood - Fancy bleed for show jumping. 
Quarter Horse - you cannot go wrong with this versatile breed.
Morgan - Great hybrid. Great on both English and Western riding
Fijord Horse - My personal favorite. Not easy to find. Great for trail riding. 
Icelandic - Another one of my favorites. Short, agile and healthy breed. Great for trecking.
Arabian - Hot temperred. Could be challenging for a beginner rider. Healthy and tough. 
Andulsian - Originally from Sounth Spain. Beautiful and great for dressage. 
Shetland pony - Who doesn't want Shetland as a family pet?
Swedish warmblood - Another fancy breed for show jumping. Royal breed. 
American Paint - Beautiful and versatile. Colorful equivalant of quarter horse.
Clydesdale - If you are very tall person, you may suit to be riding this breed. Very calm, gentle breed.
