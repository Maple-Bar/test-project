Tokyo Story (Tōkyō Monogatari) is a 1953 Japanese drama film directed by Yasujirō Ozu and starring Chishū Ryū and Chieko Higashiyama about an aging couple who travel to Tokyo to visit their grown children. Upon initial release, it did not immediately gain international recognition and was considered "too Japanese" to be marketable by Japanese film exporters. It was screened in 1957 in London, where it won the inaugural Sutherland Trophy the following year, and received praise from U.S. film critics after a 1972 screening in New York City. 

Tokyo Story is widely regarded as Ozu's masterpiece and today as one of the greatest films in history of cinema. In 2012, it was voted the greatest film of all time in a poll of film directors by Sight & Sound magazine.
